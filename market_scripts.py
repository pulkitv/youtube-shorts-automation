Tata Steel Limited as on 15 November 2025

The news in focus is Tata Steel’s decision to fully acquire Tata BlueScope Steel Private Limited. On 12 November 2025, Tata Steel announced it will buy the remaining 50 percent stake from BlueScope Steel Asia for up to ₹1,100 crore, making Tata BlueScope its indirect wholly owned subsidiary. Tata Steel’s consolidated income from operations for FY 2024-25 was about ₹2,18,543 crore, while Tata BlueScope reported revenue of around ₹4,270 crore for the year ended March 2025. If we simply add the two revenue numbers, the combined figure would be roughly 2 percent higher than Tata Steel’s standalone FY 2024-25 revenue base. The company has indicated that the transaction is expected to close in about three to four months from the November announcement, which points to completion around the fourth quarter of FY 2025-26, subject to regulatory approvals.

Foseco India Limited as on 15 November 2025

The news in focus is Foseco India’s acquisition of a majority stake in Morganite Crucible (India) Limited. The board first approved the deal on 22 August 2025, and an exchange filing on 2 November 2025 updated the long-stop date for completing the share purchase. Under this transaction, Foseco India is acquiring a 75 percent stake in Morganite Crucible through a share-swap arrangement valued at about ₹654 crore. Foseco India’s last reported full-year revenue is around ₹525 crore, while Morganite Crucible’s recent annual revenue is roughly ₹182 crore. Taken together, the combined revenue would be about 35 percent higher than Foseco India’s standalone revenue base. Closing of the share purchase has been targeted for around the end of October 2025, which falls in the third quarter of FY 2025-26. That means the merged financial picture is likely to appear from the fourth quarter of FY 2025-26, once consolidation of Morganite Crucible into Foseco India’s results begins.

Mahindra & Mahindra Limited as on 15 November 2025
Educational content only. Not investment advice or recommendation

The news in focus is Mahindra & Mahindra expanding its motorsport presence by acquiring Mahindra Racing UK Limited. On 13 November 2025, M&M disclosed that its wholly owned subsidiary, Mahindra Overseas Investment Company (Mauritius) Limited, has agreed to buy the entire stake in Mahindra Racing UK from a Tech Mahindra group entity. Mahindra & Mahindra’s consolidated income from operations for FY 2024-25 stands at about ₹1,59,211 crore. Mahindra Racing UK, meanwhile, generated around ₹106 crore of revenue recently, as highlighted in Tech Mahindra’s disclosure. If we simply add Mahindra Racing UK’s revenue to M&M’s FY 2024-25 revenue base, the combined figure would be only about 0.1 percent higher, showing that this is strategically important but financially small at group level. The share purchase agreement targets completion by 31 December 2025, which falls in the third quarter of FY 2025-26.

Tata Consultancy Services Limited as on 15 November 2025
Educational content only. Not investment advice or recommendation

The news in focus is the launch of a new digital education platform by Tata Consultancy Services. On 14 November 2025, TCS announced “Team SDG Universe”, a free, interactive, story-based online platform designed to help children understand the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Built by TCS iON, the platform uses games, short videos, comics and pledges so that students aged eight and above can learn about topics like climate change, equality and responsible consumption in a simple, engaging way. The launch date communicated was 14 November 2025, coinciding with Children’s Day in India. Because this is a digital platform that is already accessible online, usage numbers and any related revenue or impact are likely to start appearing quickly. A reasonable expectation is that measurable traction and any financial contribution from this initiative will begin to be visible from the fourth quarter of FY 2025-26, as more schools and children sign up and use the service.
